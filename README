  This is some code I wrote to get familiar with using libtls, a sane and
relatively easy library to use.  I'm impressed with it.  All the programs
have the same command line parameters:  the first is the hostname to
connect to, and the second is the resource you want to obtain.  For instance,
to get the main page from <https://www.google.com/> you would do:

	GenericUnixPrompt> ./get1 www.google.com /

  All the programs assume port 443 for https:---adding support for port
overriding and maybe even parsing a URL is left as an exercise for the
reader.

get1.c

	Just a straightforward program to obtain a webpage from a secure
	website.  It uses blocking I/O, and is the minimum you need to
	obtain a webpage from a secure site.

get2.c

	This program will explicitly create the socket, then call connect()
	to establish a TCP connection.  It then uses said socket to initiate
	a secure connection via the tls_connect_cbs() function.  The custom
	read and write functions will read data directly from the socket,
	and dump the contents to some files (input.bin and output.bin for
	input and output respectively).

get3.c

	This is a proof-of-concept using non-blocking I/O to simulate use in
	an evented architecture (although it's not fully evented).  This
	also uses tls_connect_cbs() with custom read/write functions which
	should be enough to show how it would be done in a real evented
	system.
